# VS Code React Ecosystem Snippets

This is a fork from https://github.com/xabikos/vscode-react. My version modifies the export styles to be inline; adds more React snippetsâ€”options for inline (braceless) SFCs, more options for React skeletons without import or export statements, more options for React components with prop types; and begins to add snippets for the surrounding React ecosystem, for now just MobX, with Redux coming soon.

## Installation

In order to install this extension, just search for `React Ecosystem Snippets` from the extensions pane.

## Snippets pattern

The class component snippets often have multiple versions, covering vanilla React, MobX, and where appropriate, TypeScript. These snippets follow the following pattern.  They all start with `r`, followed by the rest of the command.  If there's a MobX version, there will be an `m` or `mi` immediately after the `r`.  If there's a TypeScript version, there will be a `ts` immediately after the `r`.  If there's a version using both MobX and TypeScript, it'll be `rtsm` followed by the rest of the command. 

For example: 

`rcc` generates a vanilla React class component with a default export.
`rmcc` generates the same, but with MobX boilerplate, namely the @observer decorator
`rtscc` generates the same, but with TypeScript typings
`rtsmcc` generates the same, but with both MobX @observer, and TypeScript typings.

Of course not all of those permutations exist for all snippets; for example, there are no TypeScript versions for the SFCs.

| `cdm`     | componentDidMount method |
| `cwr`     | componentWillReceiveProps method |
| `scu`     | shouldComponentUpdate method |
| `cwup`    | componentWillUpdate method |
| `cdup`    | componentDidUpdate method |
| `cwun`    | componentWillUnmount method |

| `sst`     | this.setState with object as parameter |
| `sstf`    | this.setState with function as parameter |
| `danger`  | dangerouslySetInnerHtml template|

The following table lists the supported MobX snippets.
They all begin with ```mob``` so it's easy to explore all available options.

| Trigger   | Content |
| -------:  | ------- |
| `mobimp`  | Basic MobX imports |
| `mobimpf` | Full MobX imports |
| `mobactp` | MobX action property |
| `mobactm` | MobX action method |
| `mobobs`  | MobX observable property |
| `mobcom`  | MobX computed property |


## The Generated Code

This is what the snippets above actually generate. `YourComponentName` and `yourProps` are both prompted for in the generated snippet, and | indicates where your cursor will wind up, when finished providing those values.
