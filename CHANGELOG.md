# Change Log

## 0.2.2

Updating the readme for previously added TypeScript snippets

## 0.2.1

Adding some TypeScript snippets for plain React, and MobX React class components

## 0.2.0

I'm removing all of the PropTypes options.  PropTypes are deprecated in the main React repo, in favor of the external prop-types package.  Rather than continue to generate potentially invalid code, I'll just remove them, and leave it to other extensions to provide them as needed.
